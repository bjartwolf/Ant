Developed using Vintage Studio https://github.com/moozzyk/VintageStudio
for that real Enterprisey feeling

Can also run in Relaunch64 if you install 64TASS 
I use the followin scripts
C:\Users\bjart_000\Documents\64tass-1.51.992\64tass-1.51.992\64tass.exe -C -a -i RSOURCEFILE -o ROUTFILE
C:\Users\bjart_000\Documents\WinVICE-2.4-x64\WinVICE-2.4-x64\x64.exe OUTFILE
